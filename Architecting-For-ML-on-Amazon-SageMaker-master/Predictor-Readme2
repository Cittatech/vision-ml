Predictor Team Approach
Objective - To identify if we can predict if the ship is identified in the image
1/8/19 - Accomplishments 
The following steps were completed.
    a. Environment was setup in SageMaker with 100 GB space and we used c5Xlarge type
    b. Created Kaggal account and downloaded Kagaal API keys 
    c. Installed Kaggal account into Sagemaker notebook 
    d. Downloaded the Kaggal data/library using the Kaggal API
    e. Created S3 buckets to uploaded the data
    f. Decided the approach of using the algorithm "Image Classification Increamental training Alogrithm"
    e. We have decided two-step approach.
      1. See if any block exists in the image 
      2. If there is ablock then match the pattern to determine if it a ship
      
   Tomorrow - Plan
   1. Copy all  test data to S3 bucket
   2. Build the model and test it
